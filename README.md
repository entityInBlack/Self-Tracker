### **Introduction:**

In this modern technical world, we keep ourselves busy in many activities for which we lose track of our goals and objectives of our lives. Self tracker is a software that helps to track our own activities of our lives and helps us to reach our goals. It has the feature to give us satisfaction after achieving our goals and also motivates us to reach our goals if we fall behind. We build this software using **iterative waterfall SDLC method**.

### **Objective:**

- Tracks your daily activities including sleep pattern, physical exercise, study sessions and more.
- By collecting and organizing this data, users can gain a deeper understanding of their lifestyle choices, make decisions to improve their well-being.
- Sets a challenge or task for self-improvement
- Gives a self-satisfaction after completing a task, also motivates you if you fall behind while completing a task.
- Empowers users to take control of their daily routine and aim for a healthier and balanced lifestyle.

## **Requirement gathering & analysis:**

- **Identifying stakeholders:** Identify key stakeholders, including users and experts in the development of self tracker. Potential users can be teachers, students and other professionals.
- **Requirement Gathering and Analysis:** We have to conduct thorough research through user interviews, surveys, and competitor analysis to understand user needs and expectations.
- **Feasibility Study:** Feasibility study has to be done regarding resources, budget, and technical constraints.

## **Design:**

- Creating an UI which is easy to understand and interact for users.
- There should be options for different challenges for users to select
- Users can see their progress of current task or challenge in a small section of the whole UI.
- History of the previous challenges should also be views in another section of the UI
- A section should also be developed for users to create their own personal challenge

## **Coding and Implementation:**

- During the implementation phase of a self-tracker software, translates the conceptual design should be translated into a functional and user-friendly application.
- Key components, such as user interfaces, goal-setting mechanisms, and progress tracking, are implemented according to the design
- Write code for developing challenges for users to improve themselves
- Suggest challenges to users based on their personality data received from the users
- Implement any backend logic and database connectivity if needed.

**Testing:**

- Testing is crucial at this stage to ensure the software operates smoothly and meets user expectations
- In the testing phase, Self-tracker software is refined, ensuring it meets quality standards before being released to users, providing a robust and dependable tool for effective habit monitoring and improvement.
- In the testing phase of a habit tracker software, rigorous evaluation is conducted to ensure its functionality, usability, and reliability
- Testers systematically examine key features such as goal-setting, progress tracking, and challenges to identify and resolve any potential bugs or glitches.
- Alpha testing can be done to test the software to a limited number users or testers.
- After testing is done thoroughly, the software can be moved into development stage.

##   **Deployment:**

- Release the Self-Tracker Application to a limited group of users (alpha testing).
- Monitor the application's performance and gather feedback from early users.
- Address any critical issues and make improvements as necessary.

## **Maintenance**

- Address any reported bugs or issues from the alpha testing phase.
- Implement updates to add new relaxation techniques or features.
- Prepare for a wider release (beta testing) based on the improvements made.
